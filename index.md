# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** July 2025

**BOOST Food Logger** (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains:

1. **Information We Collect**  
   - **Camera images**: When you snap or select a photo of your meal, we process it locally to detect food items.  
   - **Log entries**: We store the food labels you choose and timestamps in a local database on your device.

2. **How We Use Your Information**  
   - **On-device analysis**: All image processing (food detection) happens on your device. We never upload your photos anywhere.  
   - **Local storage**: Your chosen labels and timestamps are saved locally so you can review your food logs.

3. **Data Sharing & Third Parties**  
   - We do **not** share, sell, or rent any of your photos or logs with third parties.  
   - We use Google’s Cloud Vision API and OpenAI’s API under their Terms of Service, but **only** the raw image bytes are sent (no account identifiers), and no results are stored by those services on our behalf.

4. **Data Retention**  
   - All logs remain on your device indefinitely, until you delete them via the app.  

5. **Your Choices**  
   - You can revoke camera permission at any time via your device’s Settings → Apps → BOOST Food Logger → Permissions.  
   - Deleting the app removes all stored logs and images.

6. **Contact Us**  
   If you have questions or requests regarding your data, please contact us at:
